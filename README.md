# rix

[![builder](https://github.com/urbas/rix/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/urbas/rix/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A reimplementation of `nix` in Rust.

# Trying it out

Currently `rix` is not published anywhere, so you'll have to build it yourself.
Please follow instructions in [`CONTRIBUTE.md`](./CONTRIBUTE.md) on how to build
and run `rix`.

Keep in mind that `rix` is still in development and many features are not yet
implemented.

# Notable design choices

1. Nix expressions are transpiled to JavaScript and evaluated with V8. The idea
   is to leverage all the great work around the JS ecosystem (such as debuggers,
   fast JIT compilers, profilers, libraries, compiled code caching, source
   mapping, just to name a few).

2. Use plain-old files and directories to store metadata (instead of a central
   SQLite database). The idea is to have trully immutable stores, composable
   stores, avoid the central sqlite choke-point, and be more transparent (allow
   users to browse the store's metadata without having to learn about SQLite).

3. Shard directories that contain huge amounts of hash-prefixed files (i.e., use
   paths like `/nix/store/ca/fe/xxzzxjyhvbll1c7bkswwy36nlafx-foo-1.2.3`).

# Progress

## New sub-commands

- ğŸŒ— `build-derivation`: builds a derivation in a sandbox.

  - ğŸŒ• stage 0: creates a sandbox.
  - ğŸŒ• stage 1: builds derivations without dependencies.
  - ğŸŒ— stage 2: builds derivations with dependencies.
    - TODO: prevent internet access.
  - ğŸŒ‘ stage 3: builds fixed derivations (with internet access).
  - ğŸŒ‘ stage 4: builds X% of derivations in `nixpkgs` (assuming all dependencies
    are present).

- `transpile`: converts the given nix expression into JavaScript and prints it
  to stdout.

## Nix sub-commands

- ğŸŒ˜ `eval`

  - ğŸŒ• stage 0: evaluate basic expressions, rec attrsets, let bindings, `with`
    statement, functions
  - ğŸŒ• stage 1: lazy evaluation

    - ğŸŒ˜ built-in functions (progress: 2 out of 111)
    - ğŸŒ‘ derivations (hello world derivation)
  - ğŸŒ‘ stage 3: full implementation (all derivations in nixpkgs, nice error
    messages, etc.)

- ğŸŒ˜ `show-derivation`
